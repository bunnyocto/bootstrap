# bootstrap

Bootstrap is a project to build/create a CPU (incl. hardware), write an assembler and
disassmbler, write an operating system for it, create a programming language, write a compiler
that targets this architecture and then write the compiler in the created language. Yep, that's a 
lot of work.
